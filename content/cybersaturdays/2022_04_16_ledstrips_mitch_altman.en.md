# LED Strips Everywhere for Everyone!

{{< youtube Tgol-ZZLBRg >}}
<br/>


LED strips have become really inexpensive. Lots of people have created inexpensive methods of controlling their color and brightness. This workshop shows one way to control LED strips, to make them do what you want. We will use a very cheap Arduino clone. I'll show you everything you need to know to use existing programs -- as-is, or to hack on -- to control the colors in your world with LED strips.

## Workshop Itinerary
- Intro to Red-Green-Blue (RGB) LEDs
- Brief intro to Arduino
- How to use an Arduino to control an LED strip
- Some demos of programs you can download

#### Materials (provided by TkkrLab)
- Arduino kit  ( Arduino clone + USB cable, small breadboard, 15 LEDS, 6 switches with button, small assortiment resistors,
Male - Male Dupont kabel, 9V battery connector )
- LED strip with WS2812b LEDs 

#### Required Software
Please download the free and open source Arduino software before the workshop -- Windows, Linux, or MacOS are all fine!:
