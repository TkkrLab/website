### Hardware Hacking for the absolute beginner - Jilles Groenendijk

In this Hardware Hacking Workshop for the absolute beginner  Jilles will tell you about the challenges in hardware security and teach you how to identify the different components of a device.

The different ways you can attack hardware and will he will even show you protocols on '0' and '1' level. All in his humorous style and no no-nonsense attitude. Spending 20 euro will get you very far according to Jilles and most participants will run to the thrift shop to get their hands dirty!
