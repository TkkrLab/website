# LED Strips Everywhere for Everyone!

### Prerequisites
None -- this workshop requires no experience or knowledge

### Abstract
Learn how to light up LED strips with a cheap Arduino, and make your life trippy. For total beginners -- no knowledge needed at all. No materials needed.

# Full Description
LED strips have become really inexpensive. Lots of people have created inexpensive methods of controlling their color and brightness. This workshop shows one way to control LED strips, to make them do what you want. We will use a very cheap Arduino clone. I'll show you everything you need to know to use existing programs -- as-is, or to hack on -- to control the colors in your world with LED strips.

## Workshop Itinerary
- Intro to Red-Green-Blue (RGB) LEDs
- Brief intro to Arduino
- How to use an Arduino to control an LED strip
- Some demos of programs you can download

#### Materials
- Any Arduino board (or clone) (example)
- USB cable: one side fits into your Arduino Uno, the other side fits into your laptop (example: USB-mini to USB-A)
- LED strip with WS2812b LEDs (Neopixel) -- any length, density (example)

#### Required Software
Please download the free and open source Arduino software before the workshop -- Windows, Linux, or MacOS are all fine!:
