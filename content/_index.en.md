# What is the TkkrLab?

<br />

TkkrLab (Tukkerlab) is a space which provides members and visitors access to facilities like a lasercutter, 3D printer and an Arduino course. Due to the extensive sharing of knowledge and experience within our community there will almost always be people available to help you on your way with your creative [projects](/projects/).
<br />
<br />
In the right-top corner of our site you will find the space state. When we're open you're more than welome to come visit! 
Is gezelligheid meer jouw ding, dan is **iedere dinsdagavond** de wekelijkse bijeenkomst. De overige dagen is het rustiger en kan je aan projecten werken.
<br />
