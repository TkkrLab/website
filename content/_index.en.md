Do you want to visit us? Then come on a Tuesday evening or make [an appointment] (https://tickets.tkkrlab.space/TkkrLab/rondleiding/) for a guided tour on Thursday evening. You are also welcome when we are open (see status at the top right of this webpage).
<br />

Hackerspace TkkrLab is a community that [facilitates](https://handleidingen.tkkrlab.space/handleidingen/make_everything/) self-development in technology. Each participant has his own area of ​​interest. One person may be mainly involved with software (eg embedded, home automation, websites and more), another builds 3d printers or a CNC mill while someone else designs his own electronic circuit boards to control a robot. The common factor here is that everything is technical and / or creative in the broadest sense of the word. By exchanging knowledge and experience in our community, there is always someone present who can help you with your [projects](/projects/).

<br>

To facilitate these projects, we have various [tools](https://handleidingen.tkkrlab.space/gereedschappen/) such as 3d printers, laser cutter, electronics workbench and our own workshop that can be used by the participants. Visitors to TkkrLab are asked for a contribution. In addition, it is also just nice to talk with like-minded people about, for example, the latest development on AI, security, privacy, processors, programming languages, vim or emacs, best linux distribution and more. At TkkrLab you learn something new every day.

<br>

We regularly organize events such as lectures and workshops that are of interest to our participants and target group. These are free for everyone to follow, check our [agenda](/agenda/) for the planned [CyberSaturdays](/cybersaturdays/cybersaturday/) and other events. See our [blog](/blog/) for the latest news. 

<br>

Have we piqued your interest? Then come and visit us without any obligation and get to know our community, participants and the possibilities of hackerspace TkkrLab.
