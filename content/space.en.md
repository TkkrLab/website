## The hackerspace (lounge)

TkkrLab is a hackerspace, a physical place where nerds gather for a chat about all kind of (technical) topics.
All the gear in the space is collected by the participants, TkkrLab is 100% a place for and by geeks : together we create our space.

You can find everything what you as hacker will (geek / hobbyist / programmer / electro engineer or 'beunhaas', whatever you want to call yourself) need and more.

For more technical activities we have a fully equipped ESD safe electro workplace. We have tools and equipment so you can start building with your prototypes.
