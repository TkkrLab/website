    As Cyber Santa, I'd like to say "Ho ho ho!"
    And wish you a very Merry Xmas, you know
    Keep your passwords strong
    And your firewalls on
    And have a fantastic holiday, from Cyber Santa, with love!

The above is all generated with AI’s. The text with [chatGTP](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/) and the image with [Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com/). What a amazing world where we live in.

#### How we created these
First, I took chatGTP and created a fictional character called “Cyber Santa”, an expert in cyber security.  I asked chatGTP to write a limerich.

We used Midjourney for the picture, prompt here was :   

    Santa Claus, hyper detailed, ultra realistic, 8k, full body view, wearing a yellow suit with a fluffy white beard, a hat, and black boots. Carry tablet to keep track of who's been good in the world of cybersecurity.

Lucky (?), not everything can be replaced by AI. We had to hang the decoration ourselves.
