# 24 Juni online workshop  “Learn how to build a self-watering plant” 

This online workshop will teach you how to make your own plant watering system.

You can attend this workshop online via Zoom. If you participate and [RSVP](http://bit.ly/TkkrLabMake) all the needed hardware will be sent to you for free. 

During the event itself you will learn to build your own watering system. With the Arduino IDE and ESP8266 microprocessor you will program a sensor and a pump, so you can fully automate watering your plant.

To participate you need to have some experience in programming and a system (PC/Mac) with an USB connection.

After the workshop you can continue to improve your system with the given examples, from home or at TkkrLab.
